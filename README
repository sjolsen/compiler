The project directory is structured as follows:

	./bin       Compiled executables
	./build     Temporary directory for object files and the like
	./include   Headers
	./lib       Object archives for easier dependency management and library modularity
	./src       Library source code

Currently, the only build targets are 'clean', 'all', and 'scanner'. The former two have the standard semantics, and the last builds bin/scanner, the current driver for the scanning facilities. This driver takes as its argument the name of the file to be tokenized. Output is a stream of tokens in the form "<type, value>", or a syntax error message accompanied by the offending location in the text in the form "(line, col)".

Building this project requires a mostly C++11-compliant compiler and standard library. At this point, no third-party libraries are in use, and the build compiles under GCC 4.7.2.
